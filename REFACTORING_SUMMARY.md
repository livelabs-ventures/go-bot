# Standup Bot Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring performed to make the codebase more idiomatic Go.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Package: standup** (`/pkg/standup/standup.go`)
- **Added FileSystem Interface**: Introduced a `FileSystem` interface for better testability, allowing file operations to be mocked in tests
- **Broke Down Complex Functions**: Split the complex `SaveEntry` function into smaller, focused functions:
  - `parseExistingContent` now uses a dedicated `entryParser` type with helper methods
  - Created separate methods for parsing operations: `isHeader`, `shouldSkipLine`, `isTodayEntry`, etc.
- **Improved Code Organization**: Added helper functions like `formatItems` and `formatSection` to reduce duplication
- **Added Entry Writer Interface**: Created `EntryWriter` interface for future extensibility

### 2. **Package: cli** (`/internal/cli/root.go`)
- **Removed Duplicate Code**: Extracted all command implementations to the `commands` package
- **Simplified Structure**: The root.go file now only contains command setup and routing logic
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Command logic is now properly separated from CLI setup

### 3. **Package: git** (`/pkg/git/git.go`)
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added context to all errors using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb
- **Broke Down Complex Methods**: Split `SyncRepository` and `CommitAndPush` into smaller, focused functions:
  - `isEmptyRepository`, `fetchAll`, `getCurrentBranch`, `remoteBranchExists`, etc.
- **Added Option Types**: Introduced `PullRequestOptions` and `MergeOptions` for better API design
- **Improved Error Types**: Added `ErrNoChangesToCommit` as a sentinel error

### 4. **Package: config** (`/pkg/config/config.go`)
- **Added Validation**: Implemented `Validate()` method for configuration validation
- **Better Error Messages**: Added specific error types like `ErrConfigNotFound`
- **Improved Path Handling**: Extracted path expansion logic into dedicated methods
- **Added Type Safety**: Added methods to get typed values: `GetRepository()` and `GetUserName()`

### 5. **New Package: types** (`/pkg/types/`)
Created domain types for better type safety:
- **Repository**: Validates and parses repository format (owner/name)
- **BranchName**: Validates git branch names
- **UserName**: Validates user names and provides file-safe versions
- **CommitMessage**: Validates commit messages with title/body structure

### 6. **Test Improvements**
- Fixed all tests to work with refactored code
- Updated mock expectations to match new method signatures
- Removed obsolete test functions
- Improved test coverage for edge cases

## Design Patterns Applied

1. **Interface Segregation**: Created focused interfaces (`FileSystem`, `EntryWriter`, `CommandRunner`)
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each function now has a single, clear purpose
3. **Dependency Injection**: Used constructor injection for testability
4. **Value Objects**: Created domain types to encapsulate validation and behavior
5. **Error Wrapping**: Consistent use of error wrapping for better debugging
6. **Option Structs**: Used option structs for methods with multiple parameters

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Testability**: Interfaces allow for easy mocking and testing
2. **Improved Readability**: Smaller functions with clear names are easier to understand
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Well-organized code is easier to modify and extend
4. **Type Safety**: Domain types prevent invalid data from propagating through the system
5. **Better Error Handling**: Wrapped errors provide clear context for debugging
6. **Reduced Duplication**: Helper functions eliminate repeated code patterns

## Backward Compatibility

All refactoring maintains backward compatibility:
- Public APIs remain unchanged
- Command-line interface works exactly as before
- Configuration format is unchanged
- All existing functionality is preserved
