# Standup Bot

A simple and efficient CLI tool for managing daily standup updates via GitHub. The bot streamlines team communication by collecting standup information and committing it to a shared repository, where GitHub-Slack integration broadcasts updates to your team channel.

## Features

- üöÄ **Simple CLI interface** - Quick daily standup entries with minimal friction
- üîÑ **GitHub integration** - Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all Git operations
- üë• **Team collaboration** - Shared daily branches for all team standups
- üì¢ **Slack visibility** - Full standup content visible in Slack via PR descriptions
- üéØ **Smart workflows** - Automatic branch management and PR creation
- üíæ **Local configuration** - Stores preferences for quick daily use
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error recovery** - Saves standups locally if push fails
- ü§ñ **MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ (for building from source)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Git repository for storing standups
- GitHub-Slack integration configured for your repository

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/livelabs-ventures/go-bot.git
cd go-bot

# Build the binary
make build

# Optional: Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install
```

### Binary Distribution

Download the pre-built binary for your platform from the releases page.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

Run the bot for the first time to configure:

```bash
standup-bot
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **GitHub Repository**: The repo where standups will be stored (e.g., `org/standup-repo`)
- **Your Name**: Used for your standup file and commit attribution

Configuration is saved to `~/.standup-bot/config.json`.

### 2. Daily Standup

Run the bot each day to record your standup:

```bash
standup-bot
```

You'll answer three questions:
1. **What did you do yesterday?** (multi-line, empty line to finish)
2. **What will you do today?** (multi-line, empty line to finish)
3. **Any blockers?** (single line, can be empty)

### 3. Merge Daily Standups

At the end of the day, anyone can merge all standups:

```bash
standup-bot --merge
```

## Workflows

### Default: Pull Request Workflow

The default workflow creates a shared daily PR containing all team standups:

1. First person creates branch `standup/YYYY-MM-DD` and opens a PR
2. Subsequent team members add their standups to the same branch
3. PR description automatically updates with all standups
4. Single merge notification in Slack when PR is merged

**Benefits:**
- Full standup content visible in Slack
- One PR per day instead of one per person
- Reduced notification noise
- Clear daily boundaries

### Alternative: Direct Commit Workflow

For simpler setups, use direct commits with multi-line messages:

```bash
standup-bot --direct
```

This creates individual commits with the full standup in the commit message.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `standup-bot` | Record your daily standup (uses PR workflow) |
| `standup-bot --direct` | Record standup using direct commit workflow |
| `standup-bot --merge` | Merge today's standup pull request |
| `standup-bot --config` | Reconfigure the bot (repository, name) |
| `standup-bot --name alice` | Override configured name (useful for testing) |
| `standup-bot --json '{"yesterday":["item1"], "today":["item2"], "blockers":"None"}'` | Provide standup content as JSON |
| `standup-bot --output json` | Return results in JSON format for parsing |
| `standup-bot mcp-server` | Run the MCP server for AI assistant integration |
| `standup-bot --help` | Show help information |

## File Structure

### Standup Repository

```
stand-ups/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alice.md      # Alice's standup history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bob.md        # Bob's standup history

```

### Individual Standup File

Each person's standups are appended to their markdown file:

```markdown
# Alice's Standups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**GitHub CLI not found**
```
Error: GitHub CLI not found. Please install it from https://cli.github.com/
```
Solution: Install GitHub CLI and ensure it's in your PATH.

**Not authenticated**
```
Error: not authenticated with GitHub. Please run 'gh auth login'
```
Solution: Run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub.

**Repository not found**
```
Error: repository not found at ~/.standup-bot/repo. Please run 'standup-bot --config' to set up
```
Solution: Run `standup-bot --config` to reconfigure.

**Push failed**
If pushing fails, your standup is saved locally to `/tmp/standup-{name}-{date}.txt`. You can manually add it later or retry when network is available.

### Reset Configuration

To start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.standup-bot
standup-bot --config
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run daily**: Make it part of your morning routine
2. **Be concise**: Bullet points work well
3. **Merge regularly**: Designate someone to merge at day's end
4. **Review together**: Use merged PRs for team standup meetings
5. **Keep history**: The markdown files serve as a searchable archive

## Scriptable Mode

The standup bot can be used programmatically by LLMs, scripts, and other automation tools.

### JSON Input

Provide standup content as JSON instead of interactive prompts:

```bash
standup-bot --json '{
  "yesterday": ["Implemented user authentication", "Fixed login bug"],
  "today": ["Write unit tests", "Start on user profile feature"],
  "blockers": "None"
}'
```

### JSON Output

Get machine-readable output for parsing:

```bash
standup-bot --output json --json '{
  "yesterday": ["Completed API endpoints"],
  "today": ["Frontend integration"],
  "blockers": "None"
}'
```

Output example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Standup recorded successfully",
  "date": "2025-07-31",
  "user": "alice",
  "yesterday": ["Completed API endpoints"],
  "today": ["Frontend integration"],
  "blockers": "None",
  "file_path": "/home/alice/.standup-bot/repo/stand-ups/alice.md",
  "pr_number": "42",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/standup-repo/pull/42"
}
```

### Automation Examples

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
```bash
# Include in GitHub Actions to track deployment activities
standup-bot --json '{
  "yesterday": ["Deployed version 1.2.3 to production"],
  "today": ["Monitor metrics", "Address any issues"],
  "blockers": "None"
}' --output json
```

### Error Handling

Errors are returned in JSON format when using `--output json`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "failed to parse JSON input: unexpected end of JSON input",
  "date": "2025-07-31"
}
```

## MCP Server Integration

The standup-bot includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with standup functionality.

### Running the MCP Server

```bash
standup-bot mcp-server
```

### Available MCP Tools

- **submit_standup** - Submit daily standup with yesterday/today/blockers
- **create_standup_pr** - Create or manage standup pull requests  
- **get_standup_status** - Check if today's standup is complete

### AI Assistant Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "standup-bot": {
      "command": "/path/to/standup-bot",
      "args": ["mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [MCP Server Documentation](docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for detailed information.

## Testing with Multiple Users

To test the bot with multiple users without changing your configuration:

```bash
# Record standup as yourself
standup-bot

# Record standup as Alice (for testing)
standup-bot --name alice

# Record standup as Bob (for testing)
standup-bot --name bob
```

This is useful for:
- Testing the shared daily PR workflow
- Demonstrating the tool to your team
- Debugging multi-user scenarios
